Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a well-established technique for retinal diagnostics, now expanding into non-ophthalmological fields such as dermatology, oncology, mucosal tissue diagnostics and more. OCT boasts mesoscopic resolution, implying that the resolution volume encompasses only a few cells. It also offers a deeper penetration depth (approximately a few millimeters) compared to microscopy, effectively bridging the gap between ultrasound and microscopy.
The OCT signal features are highly sensitive to the properties of sub-resolved optical scatterers. For example, speckle pattern parameters correlate with scatterer concentrations and scatterer clustering, while speckle variance is sensitive to scatterer motion, such as blood flow, among other features. Moreover, OCT can be made sensitive to optical phase and polarization. These features are enhanced by enabling AI.
By combining all these technology development components into a seamless pipeline, one can achieve high-performance diagnostics and perform optical biopsy and virtual histology. Leveraging these advancements, numerous OCT applications have emerged over the recent decade. The majority of these approaches and applications are based on specific OCT images and signal processing.
This workshop comprises four subsequent panels and is dedicated to the whole pipeline from OCT technology development and signal formation, through signal features and preprocessing, to AI-enabling and practical implementations and applications.
